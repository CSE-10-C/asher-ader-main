    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am a high school student at <strong>The Browning School</strong> with strong interests in technology and problem-solving.
      I enjoy balancing rigorous academics with hands-on experiences through coding, robotics, debate, and competitive sports.
      I am particularly interested in learning how technology and design can be used to solve real-world problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have experience in programming (Python, HTML, CSS), computer-aided design, and collaborative team environments through
      my involvement in clubs and varsity athletics. As a <strong>co-captain of the varsity indoor track and field team</strong>,
      I value leadership, discipline, and accountability, and I enjoy motivating others to perform at their best.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of school, I have participated in enrichment programs including the Robinhood.org Summer Program and the
      Boston University Pre-College Program, earning certificates from both. These experiences have strengthened my
      interest in learning beyond the classroom and exploring future academic and professional opportunities.
